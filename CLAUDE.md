# HANDY DANDIES — Project Conventions

A three.js scene rendering a field of rigged hand instances that each point
at the cursor. See `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt` for the fuller objective/scope,
`docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt` for how the code is structured.

The dev panel follows the workspace-wide standard in the parent `CLAUDE.md`
§12 — this file only covers what's specific to this project, not a
restatement of §12 itself.

## File map

Multi-file structure (not a single-file exception): `index.html` (entry
point, import map) + `src/main.js` (all real logic) + `src/style.css` +
`src/devpanel/devPanel.js` (generic dev-panel engine, reused near-verbatim
from HANDO — add controls via `main.js`'s own `DEV_GROUPS` first; only
extend devPanel.js itself for a genuinely generic, reusable control-level
capability that engine doesn't have yet, the same way HANDO added its own
'multi-select' type when IT needed ordered pose chaining. As of 2026-09-15
this copy has ONE real divergence from HANDO's: `multi-select` rows here
also support drag-to-reorder (a `.dp-ms-row-handle` icon + the same
`setupReorder()` list-picker rows/groups already use) — see the Tween
group's own CHANGELOG.txt entry for why, and diff against HANDO's copy
before assuming the 2 engines are still byte-identical). The rigged hand
asset lives at
`data/processed/HAND3D/Hand2.glb`, copied from HANDO's own
`data/HAND3D/HAND-021/Hand2.glb`. `data/raw/`, `scripts/{active,archive}/`,
`logs/`, `results/`, `tests/` are empty standard-skeleton folders, not yet
used. See `docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt` for the full architecture writeup.

## Untouchable systems

None formally designated yet.

## Dev-panel prompt shorthand (how the user specs dev controls)

Uses the workspace-standard `*DC*`/`*D*` notation (parent `CLAUDE.md` §12g).
A bare `*D*` with no group context goes into whichever existing collapsible
group fits best (per §12g); create a new group only if none fit.

## Dev-panel behavior (project-specific judgment calls under §12)

All project-specific settings (Field Layout, Cursor Tracking, Camera,
Lighting, Toon Shading, Outline, Background, Debug) are shared across
Desktop/Mobile/Landscape — none are per-device yet, since the CURSOR-
TRACKING mechanic itself has no touch-input equivalent (same convention
DOTFLICKO used for its own mouse-only interaction). Note this is separate
from the CAMERA's own pan/zoom, which DOES have full mobile touch support
via OrbitControls — that's just not exposed as dev-panel settings, it's
built into the interaction itself. Position/size sliders (spacing, camera
position, target depth) use plain world units or a "x Field Radius"
multiplier, not %vmin — this is a three.js world-space scene, not a 2D CSS
layout, so §12a's %/vmin-vs-px guidance doesn't directly apply. **Save
Settings now uses the git-tracked settings log (§12l upgrade), added
2026-09-15** — `api/save-settings.js` (a Vercel serverless function,
ported near-verbatim from HANDO's own) writes through to
`data/processed/dev-panel-settings.json`. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and
`DEV_PANEL_SAVE_SECRET` set on this project's own Vercel project (see
README.md's own setup section for exact values/steps) — without both
set, Save/Reset surface a clear "Server not configured" error rather
than silently falling back to localStorage (this is `devPanel.js`'s own
documented single-tier design, not a bug).

Camera/lighting/target-plane framing is derived from the field's bounding
size exactly ONCE (the first hand build) and frozen after that — direct
request that Field Layout changes never affect camera view scale. Don't
reintroduce a live recompute of camera position from field size without
re-confirming that's actually wanted.

**Double Click Hold Tween (added 2026-09-15) is the one trigger group in
this project that applies IDENTICALLY to every hand at once, with no
per-hand distance stagger** — a deliberate exception to Click-Hold-Pose/
Click-Pose's own established per-hand phase-machine pattern, per direct
request ("The tween will apply to all hands simultaneously"). Computed
ONCE per frame in `animate()` (`dcHoldValues`), not once per hand — don't
copy Click-Hold-Pose's own per-hand `getOrInitHandCHP()`/stagger pattern
onto this feature without re-confirming that's actually wanted.

## Gotchas

- `three/addons/utils/SkeletonUtils.js` (three@0.169.0, pinned in
  `index.html`'s import map) exports `clone`/`retarget`/`retargetClip`
  directly — NOT a `SkeletonUtils` namespace object. `import {
  SkeletonUtils } from '...'` throws a SyntaxError at module-load time.
  Use `import { clone as cloneSkeletal } from
  'three/addons/utils/SkeletonUtils.js'`.
- `initDevPanel()` can fire a restored control's `onChange` synchronously
  before scene objects (`camera`, `keyLight`, etc.) exist yet in `main.js`
  — a TDZ crash. `main.js` detaches every control's `onChange` into a
  `Map` immediately before calling `initDevPanel()` and reattaches them
  right after; any new `DEV_GROUPS` control added later is automatically
  covered by this same block. See `docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt`'s own GOTCHAS
  for the full detail and HANDO's precedent for this exact mitigation.
- A local static server / ES-module imports can serve a stale cached copy
  of `main.js` even after reloading — a hard reload of the page's own URL
  isn't always enough for a multi-file ES-module app. Bump a cache-busting
  query string on the top-level navigation (e.g. `index.html?t=2`) if a
  fix doesn't appear to take effect. Separately, this workspace's own
  `read_console_messages` browser tool can report a STALE, already-fixed
  console error as if it were still current — cross-check against a fresh
  screenshot/network request before trusting a lingering console error.
- `depthTest: false` on both hand materials (required to make cursor-
  distance render ordering actually visible — three.js's normal depth-
  tested compositing otherwise always lets real camera depth win over
  `renderOrder`) means a single hand's OWN internal self-occlusion now
  relies on front-face culling + triangle submission order, not a real
  depth test. `depthWrite` stays ON so the depth buffer still ends up
  populated (whichever hand visually won at each pixel). See
  `docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt`'s own GOTCHAS for the full detail.
- `window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight` can read 0 at script-parse time in this
  dev environment, permanently zero-sizing the renderer/`EffectComposer`/
  `OutlinePass` unless self-healed every frame — `main.js`'s `animate()`
  compares `renderer.getSize()` against the current window size and
  re-applies the full resize on any mismatch. Separately (a DIFFERENT
  issue, not fixed by that self-heal): this session's own browser-
  automation tool reports `document.hidden`/`innerWidth === 0` whenever
  queried via its JS-execution path, even on a freshly-foregrounded tab,
  while a screenshot on the same tab at the same moment renders correctly
  — a characteristic of that tool, not a page bug. See
  `docs/CODE_SUMMARY.txt`'s own GOTCHAS for the full detail on both.
- A quaternion conjugation of the form `W * delta * W^-1` (used in
  `applyCurlToSkeleton()`'s curl-axis math) is ALWAYS identity when
  `delta` is exactly identity, regardless of `W` — silently discarding
  whatever `W` was meant to contribute. Any test methodology that only
  checks self-consistency across a range of `delta` values (e.g.
  comparing a finger's orientation relative to the wrist at 2 different
  wristSplay values) can pass at 0.0000° even when the formula is
  absolutely wrong, because a systematically-biased-but-self-consistent
  formula satisfies that kind of test too. Confirmed live 2026-09-15: the
  prior "corrected" formula passed every relative-to-wrist invariance
  test run against it this whole session, yet was still wrong — it just
  happened that every test case used a nonzero wristSplay, so the
  delta=identity degenerate case (e.g. the "Fist" pose, wristSplay=0)
  was never exercised until a real saved pose hit it in production. When
  verifying a conjugation-based fix, always test the degenerate case
  (delta=identity) explicitly, not just a range of nonzero deltas — see
  CHANGELOG.txt's 2026-09-15 entry for the full fix.
- **Pose-tuning constants shared with HANDO (`FINGER_SIGN`, `FINGER_MAX_DEG`,
  `FINGER_CURL_AXIS`, etc.) can silently drift out of sync.** HANDO
  changed `FINGER_SIGN.middle`/`.ring` from `-1` to `1` on 2026-09-14 (and
  migrated its own saved poses to match), but that change was never
  ported here, causing every real pose with nonzero curlMiddle/curlRing
  to curl those 2 fingers backward — confirmed live 2026-09-15, mistaken
  for a wrist-splay bug for a while since "Neutral"/"Neutral - Bent Back"
  (the poses used to verify the actual wrist-splay fix above) happen to
  be the only 2 saved poses with every curl value at 0, where a sign
  error is invisible. Before trusting any of this project's own finger-
  tuning constants, diff them against HANDO's current values (`grep -n
  "FINGER_SIGN\|FINGER_MAX_DEG\|FINGER_CURL_AXIS" src/main.js` in both
  projects) rather than assuming a one-time port stayed in sync — see
  CHANGELOG.txt's 2nd 2026-09-15 entry for the full account.
- **Any per-hand "current state" field seeded from a shared value at hand-
  creation time (e.g. `hand.currentBaseQuat: cloneBaseQuat.clone()` in
  `rebuildField()`) captures whatever that shared value IS AT THAT EXACT
  MOMENT — including a stale module-load-time default if cfg hasn't
  finished restoring yet when the field first builds.** A per-frame
  unconditional resync silently self-heals this within 1 frame; GATING
  that resync behind a condition that isn't unconditionally true on a
  hand's very first frame (e.g. `updateRenderOrder()`'s own
  `needsIdleRepose` performance gate, added 2026-09-15) can leave a hand
  frozen on the stale value indefinitely — confirmed live 2026-09-15: a
  real user's `hands[0].currentBaseQuat` read literal identity
  (`[0,0,0,1]`) on a fresh hard refresh, rendering every hand as its raw,
  un-posed GLB bind pose ("weird surface texture... rotation looks off"),
  while `cloneBaseQuat` itself already held the correct value — any click
  "fixed" it only as a lucky side effect (of `_wasOverriddenLastFrame` or
  the click's own independent repose), not a real fix. Any future
  performance gate added to a per-frame idle-state sync needs its own
  "has this ever actually run once for this instance" escape hatch (see
  `hand.everReposed`) — see CHANGELOG.txt's 7th 2026-09-15 entry for the
  full account.
- **This session's browser-automation tool (`mcp__Claude_Browser__*`) can
  misreport `document.hidden: true` / `window.innerWidth: 0` /
  `renderer.info.render.frame` stuck / `requestAnimationFrame` never
  firing to a page's OWN JS, even on a tab that was just explicitly
  fronted and is genuinely interactive** — confirmed live 2026-09-15 with
  an INDEPENDENT `requestAnimationFrame` probe (nothing to do with this
  app's own code) that also showed 0 increments over 2 real seconds,
  ruling out an app-level cause. `computer{action:"screenshot"}` still
  renders correctly in this same state and is what actually surfaced the
  real bug above — when investigating anything live-rendering-related,
  don't trust a JS-exec-based query (`window.innerWidth`, a manual rAF
  probe, `renderer.info`) as proof the page itself is broken; cross-check
  with a real screenshot, or bypass the render loop entirely by calling
  the relevant update function directly (e.g. `window.__debug.updateRenderOrder()`)
  and inspecting the resulting state.
